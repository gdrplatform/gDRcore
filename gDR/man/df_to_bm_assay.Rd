)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{tibble or data.frame with drug-response data}

\item{data_type}{string type of data to be returned: all, for untreated conditions only ('untreated')
or for treated conditions only ('treated')}

\item{discard_keys}{a vector of keys that should be discarded}

\value{
BumpyMatrix object
}
\description{
Convert data.frame with dose-reponse data into a BumpyMatrix assay.
}
\details{
The 'assay' is simply a BumpyMatrix object with rownames being the treatment ids,
colnames being the ids of the cell lines and values with
dose-response data for given cell lines under given conditions.
